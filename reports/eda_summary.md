1. Our data has no null data.
2. Numerical data have outliers - some has a few number and some has higher number.
3. Data is not balanced, whether numerical and categorical data.
4. Based on the histogram plots, the data is normally distributed almost.
5. On checking correlation with the target columns, it can be seen the data is giving realistic response. Strong positive relation with family diabetes history, age, bmi and so.
